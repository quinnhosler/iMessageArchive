# iMessage Archive

Currently a barebones implementation, this script will copy iMessage files from an iPhone backup and place them within a folder named `_export` on the desktop.

## Usage

`python backup.py "$backup_hash$""`

where `$backup_hash` is the name of the folder you want to back up found in `$HOME/Library/Application Support/MobileSync`
